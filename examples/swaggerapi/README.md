# SwaggerAPI example

## Getting Started

A high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/).

The World's Most Popular Framework for APIs. [Swagger](http://swagger.io)

For all of the module's more complete details and instructions, go to the [module's README.md](../../modules/swaggerapi/README.md).

### Start the web server:

```
go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel
go get github.com/waiteb3/revel-swagger/examples/swaggerapi/...
go get github.com/hieubq-vng/revel-swagger/go-swagger/spec
revel run github.com/waiteb3/revel-swagger/examples/swaggerapi
```

Then go to [http://localhost:9000/@api/](http://localhost:9000/@api/) and you'll see
the example SwaggerAPI's UI for this projects swagger definition.

Or you can go to [http://localhost:9000/@custom/](http://localhost:9000/@custom/) to see an example of a custom Swagger UI.
You can read also [instructions](../../modules/swaggerapi/README.md#custom-ui) on how to add your own custom Swagger UI distribution.

Thanks to [https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui](https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui) for a modified swagger-ui to demo with.

**Note**: If you get a compilation error from a package not being found,
try refreshing once or twice since the revel tool may not have cloned the package yet.

app

    The app directory contains the source code and templates for your application.

conf

    The conf directory contains the applicationâ€™s configuration files.
    There are two main configuration files:

    * app.conf, the main configuration file for the application, which contains standard configuration parameters
    * routes, the routes definition file.

conf/swagger

    The swagger subdirectory contains the application's swagger specification files.
    This project has one file:

	* swagger.yml, the swagger-specification definition file.

app/controllers
* [App.Endpoint extension declaration](conf/swagger/swagger.yml#L19)
* [Items.{Action} example extension declaration](conf/swagger/swagger.yml#L29)

```
    The implementations for controller and their actions that are invoked by
    a pathItem's 'x-revel-controller-action'.

    * api.go, the App.Endpoint implementation
    * items.go, the Items.{Action} implementations
```

public

    Resources stored in the public directory are static assets that are served
    directly by the Web server. Typically it is split into three standard sub-directories
    for images, CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

    The names of these directories may be anything; the developer need only update the routes.

public/swagger-ui

   Swagger UI assets are served from this directory.

test

    Tests are kept in the tests directory. Revel provides a testing framework that makes it easy to write and run functional tests against your application.
