# SwaggerAPI example

## Getting Started

A high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/).

The World's Most Popular Framework for APIs. [Swagger API](http://swagger.io)

### Start the web server:

```
go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel
go get github.com/waiteb3/revel-swagger/...
revel run github.com/waiteb3/revel-swagger/examples/swaggerapi
```

Then go to [http://localhost:9000/@api/](http://localhost:9000/@api/) and you'll see
the example SwaggerAPI's UI for this projects swagger definition.

### Custom UI

You can use Static.Serve (the offical Revel module) to serve your UI.

Example from the routes file
```
# Custom Swagger UI
GET /@custom/swagger.json                       Static.Serve("conf/swagger","swagger.json"
GET /@custom/                                   Static.Serve("public/swagger-ui/dist","index.html")
GET /@custom/*filepath                          Static.Serve("public/swagger-ui/dist")
```

Then go to [http://localhost:9000/@custom/](http://localhost:9000/@custom/) to see
the custom UI.

Thanks to https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui for a modified swagger-ui to demo with.

app

    The app directory contains the source code and templates for your application.

conf

    The conf directory contains the applicationâ€™s configuration files. There are two main configuration files:

    * app.conf, the main configuration file for the application, which contains standard configuration parameters
    * routes, the routes definition file.

swagger

    The swagger subdirectory contains the application's swagger specification files. This project has one file:

	* swagger.yml, the swagger-specification definition file.

controllers

    The implementations for controller-actions that can be invoked by a pathItem's 'x-revel-controller-action' extension definition.

    * api.go, the App.Endpoint implementation for [examples/swaggerapi/conf/swagger.yml#L22](the swagger spec)

public

    Resources stored in the public directory are static assets that are served directly by the Web server. Typically it is split into three standard sub-directories for images, CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

    The names of these directories may be anything; the developer need only update the routes.

test

    Tests are kept in the tests directory. Revel provides a testing framework that makes it easy to write and run functional tests against your application.

### Follow the guidelines to start developing your application:

* The README file created within your application.
* The [Getting Started with Revel](http://revel.github.io/tutorial/index.html).
* The [Revel guides](http://revel.github.io/manual/index.html).
* The [Revel sample apps](http://revel.github.io/samples/index.html).
