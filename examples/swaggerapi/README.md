# SwaggerAPI example

## Getting Started

A high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/).

The World's Most Popular Framework for APIs. [Swagger](http://swagger.io)

For all of the module's details and instructions, go to the [README.md](modules/swaggerapi/README.md).

### Start the web server:

```
go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel
go get github.com/waiteb3/revel-swagger/examples/swaggerapi/...
revel run github.com/waiteb3/revel-swagger/examples/swaggerapi
```

Then go to [http://localhost:9000/@api/](http://localhost:9000/@api/) and you'll see
the example SwaggerAPI's UI for this projects swagger definition.

Or you can go to [http://localhost:9000/@custom/](http://localhost:9000/@custom/) to see an example of a custom Swagger UI. [Instructions](modules/swaggerapi/README.md#custom-ui) on how to add your own Swagger UI distribution.

        swagger-ui        Custom UI file

app

    The app directory contains the source code and templates for your application.

conf

    The conf directory contains the applicationâ€™s configuration files. There are two main configuration files:

    * app.conf, the main configuration file for the application, which contains standard configuration parameters
    * routes, the routes definition file.

swagger

    The swagger subdirectory contains the application's swagger specification files. This project has one file:

	* swagger.yml, the swagger-specification definition file.

controllers

    The implementations for controller-actions that can be invoked by a pathItem's 'x-revel-controller-action' extension definition.

    * api.go, the App.Endpoint implementation for [the swagger spec](examples/swaggerapi/conf/swagger/swagger.yml#L15)
    * items.go, the Items.{_Action_} implementations for [the swagger spec](examples/swaggerapi/conf/swagger/swagger.yml#L25)

public

    Resources stored in the public directory are static assets that are served directly by the Web server. Typically it is split into three standard sub-directories for images, CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

    The names of these directories may be anything; the developer need only update the routes.

test

    Tests are kept in the tests directory. Revel provides a testing framework that makes it easy to write and run functional tests against your application.
